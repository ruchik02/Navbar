this is navabar page in which i'm using html , css and javascript 
in css i'm using media query in media links height is auto becuase if we not used
then it will take toggle height and we use toggle button once it hide it can not be shown that's why 
links height will be auto 
in javascript i'm used add event listener in nav-toggle when click on navToggle button then it works as a toggle 
toggle means if it show then hide 
if its hide then show
